# OVN-Kubernetes Node Identity

## Introduction

The OVN-Kubernetes node identity feature introduces a per-node client certificate for ovnkube-node pods,
together with a [validating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook), 
enabling granular permission enforcement specific to ovn-kubernetes.
Previously, all `ovnkube-node` pods shared a common service account, 
with their API permissions managed only through Kubernetes [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) rules.\
The goal of this feature is to limit `ovnkube-node` permissions to the minimum required for networking management on a specific Kubernetes node.
We will mimic the [approach used by kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/) in which every node has a unique identity, 
and its API write requests are verified using a [noderestriction](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/9e0569f2ed3934060fabe51be4e15232bbea3877/plugin/pkg/admission/noderestriction/admission.go) validating admission webhook. 

## Per-node client certificates

This process mimics the [bootstrap initialization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#bootstrap-initialization) in kubelet.
When the `ovnkube-node` starts for the first time, it uses the host's `kubeconfig` to create a [CertificateSigningRequest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/)
that requests a client certificate for the `system:ovn-node:<nodeName>` user in the `system:ovn-nodes` group.
This request is then signed by the [kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers) signer.

For the certificate to be signed, it must first be approved.
The newly introduced `OVNKubeCSRController` component approves or denies `CertificateSigningRequests` created for users with the `system:ovn-node` prefix.
The `OVNKubeCSRController` performs several checks to validate the requested certificate, including:
- Ensuring that the node name extracted from the request matches the node name of the user that sent it.
- Verifying that the group is set to `system:ovn-nodes`.
- Checking that the certificate expiration does not exceed the maximum allowed duration.

Once the certificate is approved and signed, `ovnkube-node` uses it to communicate with the API server and request a new certificate upon expiration.
The RBAC rules are consistent across all `ovnkube-node` pods, we use the `system:ovn-nodes` group as the subject for Role/ClusterRole bindings to avoid duplication:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
    name: ovnkube-node
roleRef:
    name: ovnkube-node
    kind: ClusterRole
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
    - kind: Group
      name: system:ovn-nodes
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Validating Admission Webhook

The feature introduces a validating webhook for updates to `pod/status` (Interconnect only) and `node/status`.\
The `ovnkube-node` pod exclusively updates the status on both resources, so it is sufficient to verify only update requests.\
The webhooks include the following checks for each `ovnkube-node` pod:
- Modifying annotations on pods hosted on its own node.
- Modifying annotations on its own node.
- Modifying only allowed annotations.
- Not modifying anything other than annotations.

Some of the allowed annotations have additional checks; for instance, the IP addresses in `k8s.ovn.org/pod-networks`
must match the node's `k8s.ovn.org/node-subnets` networks.
